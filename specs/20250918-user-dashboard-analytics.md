# Feature Specification: User Dashboard Analytics

**Created:** 2025-09-18
**Issue:** #38
**Status:** Implemented

## User Need
Users need visibility into their application usage patterns and behavior to make informed decisions about their workflow efficiency and feature adoption. Currently, users have no insights into how they interact with the dashboard or which features provide the most value.

## Functional Requirements  
1. **Page View Tracking**: Track which dashboard sections users visit most frequently
2. **Time Spent Analytics**: Monitor how long users spend in different areas
3. **Feature Usage Metrics**: Count interactions with key UI components (buttons, links, forms)
4. **Session Analytics**: Track user session duration and frequency
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Display aggregated metrics in a dedicated analytics view
6. **Privacy Compliance**: Ensure all tracking respects user privacy and follows best practices

## User Experience
- **Analytics Access**: Users can navigate to `/dashboard/analytics` to view their usage data
- **Visual Display**: Clean, chart-based visualization of key metrics
- **Time Filtering**: Users can filter analytics by time periods (week, month, quarter)
- **Feature Flag Control**: Analytics can be enabled/disabled via feature flag
- **Non-Intrusive**: Analytics collection happens transparently without affecting UX

## Success Criteria
- [x] Analytics collection works on all dashboard pages
- [x] Analytics dashboard renders usage metrics accurately  
- [x] Feature flag properly enables/disables analytics collection
- [x] No performance impact on existing dashboard functionality
- [x] Privacy-compliant data collection (no PII, local storage only)

## Out of Scope
- Cross-device analytics correlation
- User comparison or benchmarking features
- External analytics service integration (Google Analytics, etc.)
- Historical data migration or persistence beyond browser storage
- Real-time analytics streaming

## Clarifications Needed
- ✅ Local storage only (no external analytics services)
- ✅ Feature flag implementation using environment variables
- ✅ Chart library selection (lightweight, no external dependencies preferred)
