**Slash Command:** `/test:scaffold`

**Goal:**  
Write failing tests from approved plan before implementation.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) Write failing tests only from the approved plan.
3) Create test files in the target directory (default: `__tests__`, override with `testDir` argument):
   - `__tests__/` for unit tests
   - `tests/e2e/` for end-to-end tests
4) Follow naming: `ComponentName.test.ts` or `feature-name.test.ts`
5) Tests should fail initially - do not implement functionality yet.
6) Produce test **artifacts** and **link** results in related Issue/PR.
7) Emit **Result**: tests created, failure status, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/test:scaffold unit` → creates unit test files
- `/test:scaffold --dry-run` → show planned test structure only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If no plan exists → suggest `/dev:plan-feature` first.
- If tests pass initially → verify they test the right functionality.
