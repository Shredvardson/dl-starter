**Slash Command:** `/github:capture-learning`

**Goal:**  
Update an existing issue with implementation outcomes and learnings.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight/spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) Find the related GitHub issue for our current work and update the outcome section with:
   - What actually happened vs planned
   - Key learnings and patterns discovered
   - Links to created artifacts (PRs, docs, wiki updates)
   - Follow-up issues or tasks identified
   - Reusable patterns for similar future work
3) Close the issue if complete or update status/labels appropriately.
4) Produce learning **artifacts** and **link** results in the related Issue/PR.
5) Emit **Result**: issue updated, learnings captured, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/github:capture-learning #42` → updates issue #42 with learnings
- `/github:capture-learning --dry-run` → show planned learning capture only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If target issue missing → comment on current PR with remediation steps.
- If no learnings to capture → suggest documenting implementation patterns.
