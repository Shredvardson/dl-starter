**Slash Command:** `/github:create-issue`

**Goal:**  
Create a GitHub issue from current planning discussion with proper template.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight/spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) Create a GitHub issue based on our current conversation.
3) Use the most appropriate template (ai-collaboration, learning-spike, refactor-secure, or standard).
4) Include all relevant context, links to related issues, and clear acceptance criteria.
5) Auto-assign appropriate labels and link to project board.
6) Produce issue **artifacts** and **link** results, return the created issue URL for tracking.
7) Emit **Result**: issue created, URL provided, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/github:create-issue ai-collaboration` → creates issue with AI collaboration template
- `/github:create-issue --dry-run` → show planned issue content only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If template missing → use standard template and suggest template creation.
- If context unclear → ask for specific issue details and acceptance criteria.
