# /plan

You are architect-dev. Open the same spec file and ONLY refine:

- Plan: finalize tiny schema/API (inline), name tables, field types.
- Dev Tasks: break into atomic steps executable by an agent.
  Keep â‰¤900 words. No new files. If feature needs a contract or large SQL, propose ONE optional file name in Notes.
