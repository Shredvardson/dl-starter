# Prepare PR

Create conventional commit and PR body:

1. Stage changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with format: `type(scope): description`
3. Generate PR body with:
   - Summary of changes
   - Link to issue: `Closes #123`
   - Testing checklist
   - Breaking changes (if any)

Reference files in `src/app/` that were modified.
