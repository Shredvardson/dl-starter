**Slash Command:** `/git:workflow`

**Goal:**  
Manage git branch lifecycle using consolidated workflow operations.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight/spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) If `requiresHITL` true, ask for human confirmation citing `riskPolicyRef`.  
3) Execute consolidated git operations using `scripts/git-workflow.sh`:
   - `pnpm git:start <branch-name>` - Start new feature branch
   - `pnpm git:status` - Comprehensive git status
   - `pnpm git:cleanup` - Preview branch cleanup (dry-run)
   - `pnpm git:cleanup-force` - Execute branch cleanup
   - `pnpm git:finish` - Clean current branch after merge
4) Follow branch lifecycle: Start → Work → PR → Finish
5) Leverage safety features: protected branches, PR checks, dry-run previews.
6) Produce workflow **artifacts** and **link** results in related Issue/PR.
7) Emit **Result**: operation completed, branch status, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/git:workflow start fix/login-bug` → starts new feature branch
- `/git:workflow --dry-run` → show planned git operations only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If uncommitted changes exist → suggest stashing or committing first.
- If branch conflicts → provide resolution guidance.
