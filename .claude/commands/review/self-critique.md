**Slash Command:** `/review:self-critique`

**Goal:**  
Start fresh session and skeptically review recent changes for quality.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight/spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) Perform skeptical review of recent changes:
   - Read modified files in `src/app/` and tests
   - Check for logic errors, edge cases
   - Verify TypeScript types are correct
   - Test error handling
   - Validate accessibility and performance
3) Suggest specific improvements with file:line references.
4) Produce quality **report** and **link** results in related Issue/PR.
5) Emit **Result**: review findings, improvement suggestions, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/review:self-critique` → performs comprehensive quality review
- `/review:self-critique --dry-run` → show planned review scope only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If no recent changes found → suggest reviewing specific files or components.
- If review scope unclear → ask for specific areas to focus on.
