# Self Critique

Start fresh session and skeptically review recent changes:

- Read modified files in `src/app/` and tests
- Check for logic errors, edge cases
- Verify TypeScript types are correct
- Test error handling
- Validate accessibility and performance
- Suggest specific improvements with file:line references
