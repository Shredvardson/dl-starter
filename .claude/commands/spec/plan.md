**Slash Command:** `/plan`

**Goal:**  
Create technical implementation plan within constitutional constraints.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) If `requiresHITL` true, ask for human confirmation citing `riskPolicyRef`.  
3) Create detailed technical plan for the specified feature with:
   - Architecture Decision (Next.js/TypeScript/Tailwind alignment)
   - File Changes Required (exact `src/**` paths)
   - Implementation Strategy (components, state, APIs)
   - Testing Strategy (TDD order: contracts, integration, e2e, unit)
   - Security Considerations
   - Dependencies and justification
   - Risks & Mitigation
4) Must reference existing specification from `/specify` command.
5) Save plan to `/plans/` folder and update GitHub issue.
6) Emit **Result**: plan created, technical context added, ready for `/tasks` command.

**Examples:**  
- `/plan` → creates technical implementation plan
- `/plan --dry-run` → show planned technical approach only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If no specification exists → suggest running `/specify` first.
- If constitutional constraints unclear → reference `docs/constitution.md`.
