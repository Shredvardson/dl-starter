**Slash Command:** `/tasks`

**Goal:**  
Break down technical plan into actionable implementation tasks with TDD focus.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight/spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) If `requiresHITL` true, ask for human confirmation citing `riskPolicyRef`.  
3) Create actionable task breakdown following constitutional order:
   - Phase 1: Contracts & Interfaces
   - Phase 2: Test Foundation (integration → e2e → unit)
   - Phase 3: Implementation
   - Phase 4: Integration & Polish
   - Phase 5: Documentation & Release
4) Reference existing plan from `/plan` command in `/plans/` folder.
5) Include implementation commands, branch strategy, and next steps.
6) Save breakdown to `/tasks/` folder and update GitHub issue with checklist.
7) Create feature branch ready for implementation.
8) Emit **Result**: tasks created, branch ready, implementation can begin.

**Examples:**  
- `/tasks` → creates implementation task breakdown
- `/tasks --dry-run` → show planned task structure only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If no plan exists → suggest running `/plan` first.
- If TDD workflow unclear → reference constitutional implementation order.
