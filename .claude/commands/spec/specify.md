**Slash Command:** `/specify`

**Goal:**  
Define pure requirements - what and why only, no technical details.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) Create a feature specification focused ONLY on what users need and why.
3) Constraints:
   - NO tech stack, APIs, or implementation details
   - NO "how" - only "what" and "why"
   - Mark ALL ambiguities with [NEEDS_CLARIFICATION]
   - Reference existing features and user workflows
   - Focus on user value and business requirements
4) Format output with User Need, Functional Requirements, User Experience, Success Criteria, and Clarifications Needed.
5) Auto-number the feature sequentially and save to `/specs/` folder.
6) Create GitHub issue linking to this specification.
7) Emit **Result**: specification created, issue URL, ready for `/plan` command.

**Examples:**  
- `/specify` → creates feature specification and GitHub issue
- `/specify --dry-run` → show planned specification structure only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If requirements unclear → ask for clarification on user needs and value.
- If scope too large → suggest breaking into smaller features.
