**Slash Command:** `/dev:refactor-secure`

**Goal:**  
Improve code clarity and performance while checking OWASP Top 10 security risks.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight/spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) If `requiresHITL` true, ask for human confirmation citing `riskPolicyRef`.  
3) Analyze and improve code security focusing on:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Authentication/authorization checks
   - Data exposure prevention
   - XSS/CSRF protection
   - Dependency vulnerabilities
4) Focus on `src/app/` routes and API endpoints. Maintain test compatibility.
5) Produce security analysis **report** and **link** results in related Issue/PR.
6) Emit **Result**: security improvements made, test status, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/dev:refactor-secure` → performs security analysis and refactoring
- `/dev:refactor-secure --dry-run` → show planned security improvements only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If tests break after refactoring → revert changes and report issues.
- If no security issues found → document clean security status.
