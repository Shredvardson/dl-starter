# Refactor Secure

Improve code clarity and performance while checking OWASP Top 10 risks:

- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication/authorization checks
- Data exposure prevention
- XSS/CSRF protection
- Dependency vulnerabilities

Focus on `src/app/` routes and API endpoints. Maintain test compatibility.
