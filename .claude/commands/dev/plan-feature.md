**Slash Command:** `/dev:plan-feature`

**Goal:**  
Plan a small, safe feature with clear acceptance criteria.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) Plan a minimal change.
3) Return: scope, files to edit (src/** only), risks, and a tiny test list.
4) Constraints: no new deps unless essential; keep UI basic; respect tokens; env via @/lib/env.
5) Done when:
   - [ ] All planned files updated with minimal changes
   - [ ] Tests for the tiny list pass locally (`pnpm test`)
   - [ ] No new deps; typecheck passes (`pnpm typecheck`)
6) Produce planning **artifacts** and **link** results in related Issue/PR.
7) Emit **Result**: plan created, scope defined, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/dev:plan-feature` → creates feature implementation plan
- `/dev:plan-feature --dry-run` → show planned approach only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If scope unclear → ask for feature clarification.
- If too complex → suggest `/specify` for spec-driven workflow.
