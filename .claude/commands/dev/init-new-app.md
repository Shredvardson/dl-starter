**Slash Command:** `/dev:init-new-app`

**Goal:**  
Initialize a new app from this starter with customized configuration.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight/spec**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) If `requiresHITL` true, ask for human confirmation citing `riskPolicyRef`.  
3) Follow initialization steps:
   - Read `docs/llm/STARTER_MANIFEST.json` and `docs/llm/NEW_APP_KICKOFF.md`
   - Propose the Plan JSON (list of files + reasons) and wait for approval if required
   - Apply minimal diffs only to the listed files
   - Run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm build`; if failing, revert and propose revised plan
4) Produce initialization **artifacts**: Plan JSON, unified diffs, and verification checklist.
5) **Link** results in related Issue/PR.
6) Emit **Result**: initialization completed, verification needed, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/dev:init-new-app` → initializes app with default configuration
- `/dev:init-new-app --dry-run` → show planned initialization changes only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If typecheck/build fails → revert changes and propose revised plan.
- If configuration unclear → ask for specific app requirements and preferences.
