**Slash Command:** `/dev:implement`

**Goal:**  
Write minimal code to make failing tests pass during TDD implementation.

**Prompt:**  
1) Confirm lane (**lightweight**) against `CLAUDE.md` decision rules.  
2) If `requiresHITL` true, ask for human confirmation citing `riskPolicyRef`.  
3) Write minimal code to make failing tests pass focusing on:
   - Core functionality in `src/app/` or `src/components/`
   - Proper TypeScript interfaces
   - Next.js App Router patterns
   - Tailwind CSS styling
4) Never change existing tests - only implement what they require.
5) Emit **Result**: what was implemented, test status, and next suggested command.

**Examples:**  
- `/dev:implement` → implements failing test requirements
- `/dev:implement --dry-run` → show planned implementation only.

**Failure & Recovery:**  
- If no failing tests → suggest `/test:scaffold` first.
- If implementation breaks existing tests → revert and ask for guidance.
