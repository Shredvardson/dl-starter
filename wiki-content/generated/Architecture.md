# Architecture Overview

## System Design

This starter implements a dual-lane AI development system:

- **Simple Lane**: For small changes, bug fixes, and routine tasks
- **Spec-Driven Lane**: For complex features requiring structured planning

## Key Components

### Command System
- Slash commands for structured workflows
- Risk-based routing and approval gates
- Machine-readable command index

### Quality Gates
- Constitutional compliance checking
- Automated testing and linting
- Security scanning and review

### GitHub Integration
- Issue templates for different workflow types
- Automated artifact cross-referencing  
- Wiki synchronization for context sharing
