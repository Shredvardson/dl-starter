# Dissonance Labs Starter Constitution

## Preamble

This constitution establishes the architectural decisions, governance patterns, and operational guidelines for the Dissonance Labs Starter project. All development lanes (Human and AI-Powered) must adhere to these principles.

## Article I: Architectural Principles

### Section 1.1: Security First
- **Secrets Management**: No secrets in code, prompts, or version control
- **Environment Isolation**: Strict separation between development, staging, and production
- **Secure Defaults**: All features implement security by default, not as an afterthought
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated and sanitized

### Section 1.2: Test-Driven Development
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: All features begin with failing tests
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for new code paths
- **Integration Testing**: Critical user journeys must have end-to-end test coverage
- **Test Isolation**: Tests must be deterministic and independent

### Section 1.3: Dependency Management
- **Least Dependencies**: Justify every new package addition
- **Security Auditing**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Version Pinning**: Lock major versions, allow minor/patch updates
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor and control frontend bundle impact

## Article II: Development Lanes

### Section 2.1: Human Development Lane
- **Primary Authority**: Human developers have final authority over all decisions
- **Code Review**: All human contributions require peer review
- **Quality Gates**: Must pass all CI/CD checks before merge
- **Documentation**: Changes require corresponding documentation updates

### Section 2.2: AI-Powered Development Lane
- **Advisory Role**: AI contributions are advisory and require human approval
- **Branch Isolation**: AI changes restricted to `bots/claude/*` branches
- **Quality Standards**: Same testing and security requirements as human lane
- **Promotion Process**: AI contributions require explicit human promotion via labels

### Section 2.3: Lane Coordination
- **No Bot-to-Bot**: AI systems cannot trigger other AI systems
- **Merge Requirements**: All AI PRs need maintainer approval and `promote` label
- **Conflict Resolution**: Human decisions override AI recommendations
- **Audit Trail**: All AI interactions must be logged and traceable

## Article III: Quality Assurance

### Section 3.1: Automated Quality Gates
- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking with no `any` types in new code
- **Linting**: ESLint/Prettier compliance required
- **Security Scanning**: Automated vulnerability detection on all PRs
- **Performance**: Bundle size and runtime performance monitoring

### Section 3.2: Manual Review Processes
- **Security Review**: Human security review for sensitive changes
- **Architecture Review**: Significant architectural changes require team consensus
- **Breaking Changes**: Breaking changes require migration guides and deprecation notices
- **Release Notes**: All releases require human-authored release notes

## Article IV: Data and Privacy

### Section 4.1: Data Minimization
- **Collect Minimally**: Only collect data necessary for functionality
- **Store Securely**: Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- **Retention Policies**: Implement data retention and deletion policies
- **User Consent**: Respect user privacy preferences and consent

### Section 4.2: Telemetry and Monitoring
- **Error Tracking**: Implement comprehensive error monitoring
- **Performance Metrics**: Track application performance and user experience
- **Privacy First**: Telemetry must not include PII or sensitive information
- **Opt-out**: Users must be able to opt out of non-essential telemetry

## Article V: Release Management

### Section 5.1: Versioning
- **Semantic Versioning**: Follow semver for all releases
- **Release Branches**: Use dedicated release branches for stabilization
- **Hotfix Process**: Defined process for emergency security/bug fixes
- **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for gradual rollouts

### Section 5.2: Deployment
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments required
- **Rollback Strategy**: Automated rollback on deployment failures
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring post-deployment
- **Change Management**: Document all production changes

## Article VI: Compliance and Governance

### Section 6.1: License Compliance
- **Open Source**: MIT license for maximum compatibility
- **Dependency Licensing**: Verify license compatibility for all dependencies
- **Attribution**: Proper attribution for all third-party code
- **Export Control**: Comply with relevant export control regulations

### Section 6.2: Security Compliance
- **Vulnerability Disclosure**: Responsible disclosure process for security issues
- **Security Updates**: Timely application of security patches
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control for all systems
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for security events

## Article VII: Amendment Process

### Section 7.1: Constitutional Changes
- **Proposal Process**: Constitutional changes require RFC process
- **Review Period**: Minimum 7-day review period for constitutional amendments
- **Consensus**: Constitutional changes require unanimous maintainer approval
- **Documentation**: All changes must be documented with rationale

### Section 7.2: Emergency Procedures
- **Security Emergencies**: Security vulnerabilities may bypass normal process
- **Rollback Authority**: Maintainers can emergency rollback any change
- **Incident Response**: Defined incident response procedures for outages
- **Post-Mortem**: All emergencies require post-incident analysis

## Article VIII: Enforcement

### Section 8.1: Automated Enforcement
- **CI/CD Gates**: Automated enforcement of quality and security standards
- **Branch Protection**: Protected branches enforce review requirements
- **Status Checks**: Required status checks prevent non-compliant merges
- **Automated Remediation**: Where possible, automatically fix policy violations

### Section 8.2: Human Oversight
- **Maintainer Authority**: Maintainers can override automated systems in emergencies
- **Appeal Process**: Contributors can appeal automated decisions
- **Education**: Focus on education over punishment for policy violations
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and improvement of enforcement mechanisms
