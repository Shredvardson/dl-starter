## Out of Scope

The following issues are typically **not considered security vulnerabilities**:

## Security Best Practices

When developing with this starter:
- Never commit secrets or API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration  
- Keep dependencies updated with `pnpm audit` and `pnpm update`
- Enable 2FA on all deployment platforms
- Review security headers in production deployments
